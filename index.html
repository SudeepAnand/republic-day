            <p class="lg:w-3/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">India achieved independence on 15th August,1947 but it was still governed by a Constitution which the British had framed for us.
                <br>Even before the achievement of independence,the Constitution Assembly had been entrusted with the task of framing a new Constitution for India.
                <br>The Constitution was completed on the 26th November,1949. It came into force on 26th January,1950. The new Constitution gave the people of India a Sovereign,Socialist,Secular,Democratic Republic. Hence 26th of January is known as the Republic Day.

            <p2 class="lg:w-3/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
                Our Republic Day is a red letter day in the history of India. On this day India fully became a Sovereign nation after centuries of foreign rule.
                <br>It ushered in an era of self-rule. India got the opportunity now to shape it destiny for itself. It has not to be dictated by any foreign country of the World,
                <br>neither in domestic nor foreign affairs.
            </p2>
            <br>
            <p3 class="lg:w-3/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">
                Since Republic Day is of immense significance it is celebrated all over India with great pomp and show,but in Delhi (the capital of India),
                <br> it is celebrated with greater grandeur and splendour.
                The programme begins with the march of the President's procession from Rashtrapati Bhavan<br> to India Gate. People in a large number flock the city from various parts of our country and abroad. VIPs,both Indian and foreigners also gather. At India Gate <br>the president take salute of the three wings of defence forces,i.e., Army, Navy, and Air Force.

                Republic Day has a grand message for us. It reminds us of the sacrifices made by the fighters for freedom, exhorts us to work hard 
                <br>for the welfare and prosperity of country's freedom and territorial intgrity. It tells us how much has been achieved and how much is still to be achieved.
                <br> It also calls upon us to work for the fulfilment of ideas which free India stands for.

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">India achieved independence from British Raj on 15 August 1947 following the Indian independence movement. The independence came through the Indian Independence Act 1947 , an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that partitioned British India into the two new independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth (later Commonwealth of Nations). India obtained its independence on 15 August 1947 as a constitutional monarchy with George VI as head of state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor-general. The country, though, did not yet have a permanent constitution; instead its laws were based on the modified colonial Government of India Act 1935. On 29 August 1947, a resolution was moved for the appointment of Drafting Committee, which was appointed to draft a permanent constitution, with Dr B R Ambedkar as chairman. While India's Independence Day celebrates its freedom from British Rule, the Republic Day celebrates the coming into force of its constitution. A draft constitution was prepared by the committee and submitted to the Constituent Assembly on 4 November 1947. The Assembly met, in sessions open to public, for 166 days, spread over a period of two years, 11 months and 18 days before adopting the Constitution. After many deliberations and some modifications, the 308 members of the Assembly signed two hand-written copies of the document (one each in Hindi and English) on 24 January 1950. Two days later which was on 26 January 1950, it came into effect throughout the whole nation. On that day, Dr. Rajendra Prasad's began his first term of office as President of the Indian Union. The Constituent Assembly became the Parliament of India under the transitional provisions of the new Constitution.

                On the eve of Republic Day, the President addresses the nation.</p>
